# Sample C Project

This directory contains a simple C project with sorting algorithms and a test suite. It is provided as a ready-to-use example for the CI/CD tutorial in the main `README.md`.

## How to Use

1.  Create a new, empty repository on your personal GitHub account (e.g., named `my-c-project`).
2.  Upload all the files from this directory (`main.c`, `sorting.c`, `sorting.h`, `Makefile`) to your new repository.
3.  You can now use your `my-c-project` repository as the target for the CI/CD integration tutorial.
